# Data Structures and Algorithms with Java

This repository contains my notes and code implementations for the Data Structures and Algorithms course using Java. The course is part of the Alpha Batch offered by Apna College.

## Journey from Learning Java to Problem Solving

I started this journey without prior knowledge of Java. However, within a short span of 5-10 days, I have dedicated my time and effort to learn Java from scratch. I have been actively studying the language, understanding its syntax, and practicing Java programming concepts.

Moreover, I have taken a step forward by applying my newly acquired Java skills to solve data structures and algorithms questions. I believe that solving these questions will not only solidify my understanding of Java but also enhance my problem-solving abilities.
